Incremental Loading\r\n- Load issues in batches rather than all at once\r\n- Progressive display as data arrives\r\n- Configurable batch sizes\r\n- Priority-based loading (visible items first)\r\n- Smooth scrolling during loading\r\n\r\n### 2. Streaming \u0026 Chunking\r\n- Stream large dependency graphs incrementally\r\n- Chunk large exports and lists\r\n- Non-blocking data processing\r\n- Progressive rendering as chunks arrive\r\n- Cancel streaming on navigation\r\n\r\n### 3. On-Demand Loading\r\n- Load issue details only when viewed\r\n- Load dependency information only when expanded\r\n- Load comments/history lazily\r\n- Cache loaded data for quick re-access\r\n- Prefetch related items in background\r\n\r\n### 4. Smart Pre-loading\r\n- Predict next likely navigation\r\n- Pre-load items near scroll position\r\n- Pre-fetch frequently accessed items\r\n- Learn from user behavior patterns\r\n- Balance pre-loading with resource usage\r\n\r\n### 5.
